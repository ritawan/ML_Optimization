# Construction of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models by optimization

This projects provides codes for logistic regression, k-mean, and neural network models from scratch without using any machine learning packages. For logistic regression and neural network, least square was used to optimized and solved the weight. The detailed mathematic methods are in corresponding notebook.
